#' A 2-stage SMART data of children with ADHD
#'
#' @description
#' We provide a two-stage sequential multiple assignment randomized trial
#' (SMART) data of 150 children with ADHD mimicking a real world study. At the
#' first stage, children were randomized to treatment of low-intensity
#' behavioral modification (BMOD) or low-intensity methamphetamine (MED) with
#' equal probability. At second stage, children were randomized to treatment of
#' low-intensity BMOD + low-intensity MED, or high-intensity with equal
#' probability. The primary outcome of study was children's school performance
#' score ranging from 1 to 5 assessed at the end of the study for all
#' participants.

#' @format A data frame with 11 columns:
#'
#' \describe{
#'   \item{\code{id}}{(factor) IDs of the 150 children.}
#'   \item{\code{o11}}{(factor) Baseline covariate encoded as 0/1: diagnosed
#'   with ODD (oppositional defiant disorder) before the first-stage
#'   intervention.}
#'   \item{\code{o12}}{(numeric) Baseline covariate: ADHD score at the end of
#'   the previous school year (ranging from 0 to 3, larger values for fewer ADHD
#'   symptoms).}
#'   \item{\code{o13}}{(factor) Baseline covariate encoded as 0/1: receiving
#'   medication during the previous school year.}
#'   \item{\code{o14}}{(factor) Baseline covariate encoded as 0/1: race - white
#'   (coded 1) versus nonwhite (coded 0).}
#'   \item{\code{a1}}{(factor) First-stage intervention encoded as -1/1: -1 for
#'   low-intensity methamphetamine (MEDS), 1 for low-intensity behavioral
#'   modification (BMOD).}
#'   \item{\code{r}}{(factor) First-stage response indicator encoded as 0/1}
#'   \item{\code{o21}}{(factor) Intermediate outcome: number of months until
#'   non-response (maximum: 8 months, NA for responders).}
#'   \item{\code{o22}}{(factor) Intermediate outcome encoded as 0/1: adherence
#'   to the first-stage intervention, 1 for high adherence.}
#'   \item{\code{a2}}{(factor) Second-stage intervention encoded as -1/1: -1 for
#'   low-intensity BMOD + MEDS, 1 for high-intensity BMOD.}
#'   \item{\code{y}}{(factor) Primary outcome (continuous): school performance
#'   at the end of the school year (ranging from 1 to 5, higher values reflect
#'   better performance)}
