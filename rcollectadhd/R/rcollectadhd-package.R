#' Collection of data sets containing ADHD related data
#'
#' This package includes data sets which have been sourced from other packages
#' on CRAN or from publications on other websites such as Kaggle. The package
#' also includes some simple functions for analysing data sets. The aim of this
#' package is to bring together data sets from a variety of ADHD research
#' publications. This package would be useful for those interested in finding
#' out what research has been done on the topic of ADHD, or those interested in
#' comparing the results from different existing works. I started this project
#' because I wanted to put together a collection of the data sets relevant to
#' ADHD research, which I have a personal interest in. The data sets and
#' descriptions of the data sets may differ from what is on CRAN or other source
#' websites.
