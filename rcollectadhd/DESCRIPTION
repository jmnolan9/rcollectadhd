Description: This package includes data sets which have been sourced from other
    packages on CRAN or from publications on other websites such as Kaggle. The 
    package also includes some simple functions for analysing data sets. The aim
    of this package is to bring together data sets from a variety of ADHD
    research publications. This package would be useful for those interested in
    finding out what research has been done on the topic of ADHD, or those
    interested in comparing the results from different existing works. I started
    this project because I wanted to put together a collection of the data sets
    relevant to ADHD research, which I have a personal interest in. The datasets
    and descriptions of the data sets may differ from what is on CRAN or other
    source websites.
