\title{A 2-stage SMART data of children with ADHD}
\format{
A data frame with 11 columns:

\describe{
\item{\code{id}}{(factor) IDs of the 150 children.}
\item{\code{o11}}{(factor) Baseline covariate encoded as 0/1: diagnosed
with ODD (oppositional defiant disorder) before the first-stage
intervention.}
\item{\code{o12}}{(numeric) Baseline covariate: ADHD score at the end of
the previous school year (ranging from 0 to 3, larger values for fewer ADHD
symptoms).}
\item{\code{o13}}{(factor) Baseline covariate encoded as 0/1: receiving
medication during the previous school year.}
\item{\code{o14}}{(factor) Baseline covariate encoded as 0/1: race - white
(coded 1) versus nonwhite (coded 0).}
\item{\code{a1}}{(factor) First-stage intervention encoded as -1/1: -1 for
low-intensity methamphetamine (MEDS), 1 for low-intensity behavioral
modification (BMOD).}
\item{\code{r}}{(factor) First-stage response indicator encoded as 0/1}
\item{\code{o21}}{(factor) Intermediate outcome: number of months until
non-response (maximum: 8 months, NA for responders).}
\item{\code{o22}}{(factor) Intermediate outcome encoded as 0/1: adherence
to the first-stage intervention, 1 for high adherence.}
\item{\code{a2}}{(factor) Second-stage intervention encoded as -1/1: -1 for
low-intensity BMOD + MEDS, 1 for high-intensity BMOD.}
\item{\code{y}}{(factor) Primary outcome (continuous): school performance
at the end of the school year (ranging from 1 to 5, higher values reflect
better performance)}

\description{
We provide a two-stage sequential multiple assignment randomized trial
(SMART) data of 150 children with ADHD mimicking a real world study. At the
first stage, children were randomized to treatment of low-intensity
behavioral modification (BMOD) or low-intensity methamphetamine (MED) with
equal probability. At second stage, children were randomized to treatment of
low-intensity BMOD + low-intensity MED, or high-intensity with equal
probability. The primary outcome of study was children's school performance
score ranging from 1 to 5 assessed at the end of the study for all
participants
