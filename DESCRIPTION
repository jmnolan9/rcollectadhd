Description: A collection of data sets relating to ADHD (Attention Deficit 
    Hyperactivity Disorder) which have been sourced from other packages on CRAN
    or from publications on other websites such as Kaggle
    <http://www.kaggle.com/>.The package also includes some simple functions for
    analysing data sets. The data sets and descriptions of the data sets may
    differ from what is on CRAN or other source websites. The aim of this
    package is to bring together data sets from a variety of ADHD research
    publications. This package would be useful for those interested in finding
    out what research has been done on the topic of ADHD, or those interested in
    comparing the results from different existing works. I started this project
    because I wanted to put together a collection of the data sets relevant to
    ADHD research, which I have a personal interest in. This work was conducted
    with the support of my mentor within the Global Talent Mentoring platform.
